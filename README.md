Demonstrates how to generate LaTex tables within PDF documents, rendered from Quarto documents.

- Need to install tinytex if you're on windows https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-engine.html
- Need to be able to manipulate dataframes by pivot_longer and pivot_wider
- Need to be able to format tables like you can in {gt} but using PDF friendly table manipulation packages such as {flextable} or {kableExtra}
